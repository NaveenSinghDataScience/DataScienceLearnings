Dataset of fruit sales:

Imagine you have the following data:

Date	   Fruit	Sales
2023-10-01	Apple	100
2023-10-01	Banana	150
2023-10-02	Apple	120
2023-10-02	Orange	180
2023-10-03	Banana	200
2023-10-03	Apple	90

And you'd like to find out the total sales for each type of fruit. You could create a pivot table to summarize this information.

Rows: Fruit (Apple, Banana, Orange)
Values: Sales (Sum)


Resulting Pivot Table :


Row Labels         Sum of Sales 

 

01-10-2023           250 

Apple                100 

Banana               150 

02-10-2023           300 

Apple                120 

Orange               180 

03-10-2023           290 

Apple                 90 

Banana               200 

Grand Total          840 









Given the summarized data provided in the table , please complete the following tasks:

* Reconstruct Dataset: Create a detailed dataset indicating the sales of different fruits on each given date. Organize the data into columns labeled "Date", "Fruit", and "Sales". Ensure that the sum of sales for each fruit on the respective dates matches the totals provided in the summarized data.

"""
Here is the detailed dataset you requested:

Date	    Fruit	Sales

2023-10-01	Apple	100

2023-10-01	Banana	150

2023-10-02	Apple	120

2023-10-02	Orange	180

2023-10-03	Banana	200

2023-10-03	Apple	90

"""

* Sales Analysis: Identify which fruit had the highest overall sales across all dates.

"""
Sales Analysis: The fruit with the highest overall sales across all dates is the Banana with a total of 350 sales.

"""


* Date Comparison: Determine the date with the highest total

"""
Date Comparison: The date with the highest total sales is 2023-10-03 with a total of 290 sales.

"""




Task 1: Sales Trend Analysis
Analyze the sales trend for each fruit over the provided dates. Are there any notable peaks or troughs? What might account for these variations?

"""
Sales Trend Analysis : The sales trend for each fruit over the provided dates is as follows:

Apple: Sales seem to be decreasing over time, with a peak on 2023-10-02 and a trough on 2023-10-03.
Banana: Sales are increasing, with a peak on 2023-10-03.
Orange: There’s only one data point for Orange, so it’s hard to identify a trend.

"""

Task 2: Top Performer
Identify the fruit with the highest cumulative sales over the given period. Can you pinpoint the date when this fruit had the highest sales?

"""
Top Performer : The fruit with the highest cumulative sales over the given period is Banana with 350 sales. The date when Banana had the highest sales is 2023-10-03.

"""

Task 3: Sales Comparison
Compare the sales of Apple and Banana on 2023-10-01. Which fruit had better sales on that specific date?

"""
Sales Comparison : On 2023-10-01, Banana had better sales (150) compared to Apple (100).

"""

Task 4: Data Filtering
Using the filter options in the PivotChart, isolate the sales data for Orange. How does its sales on 2023-10-02 compare to the other fruits on the same date?

"""
Data Filtering : On 2023-10-02, Orange had sales of 180, which is higher than Apple’s sales (120) on the same date.

"""

Task 5: Chart Customization
Customize the appearance of the PivotChart. Change its chart type, apply a different color scheme, or add data labels to enhance readability.

"""
You can easily do this in Excel by selecting the chart and using the “Chart Tools” options.

"""

Task 6: Sales Projection
Based on the given data, make a sales projection for each fruit for the next date, 2023-10-04. Use simple linear trends or averages for this projection.

"""
Sales Projection Based on simple averages:

Apple: (100+120+90)/3 = ~103
Banana: (150+200)/2 = ~175
Orange: As there’s only one data point, it’s hard to make a projection.

"""

Task 7: Data Interpretation
Interpret the reasons behind the sales fluctuations. Are there external factors (like seasonality, promotions, etc.) that might influence these sales figures?

"""
Data Interpretation : Without additional context, it’s hard to definitively interpret the reasons behind the sales fluctuations. Possible factors could include seasonality, promotions, stock availability, etc.

"""

Task 8: Anomaly Detection
Identify if there are any anomalies in the sales data. For instance, was there a date when a typically best-selling fruit had an unusual dip in sales?

"""
There doesn’t appear to be any anomalies in the given data. All fluctuations seem normal.

"""

Task 9: Interactive Exploration
Using slicers or timeline tools, create an interactive dashboard where one can filter and view sales based on specific criteria like a particular fruit or date range.

"""
You can do this in Excel using slicers or timeline tools under the “Insert” tab.

"""

Task 10: Data Expansion
Imagine and add sales data for two more fruits for the given dates. Then, update the PivotChart to incorporate this new data and analyze the extended dataset's trends and patterns.

"""
Let’s add two more fruits - Grapes and Mangoes. You can update your PivotChart in Excel to incorporate this new data and analyze the trends and patterns.
